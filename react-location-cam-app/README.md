# Location & Camera React App with Information Extraction

A comprehensive React-based web application that captures images and extracts detailed information from them.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Location Access**: Get user's current GPS coordinates with accuracy information
- **Camera Access**: Access device camera (front/back) and capture photos
- **Photo Capture**: Take photos and display them with timestamps
- **Image Upload**: Upload existing images for analysis (drag & drop or browse)
- **Download Photos**: Save captured images locally

### Information Extraction
- **📍 GPS Location Extraction**: Extract GPS coordinates embedded in image EXIF data
- **📊 Detailed Metadata**: Comprehensive file info, dimensions, EXIF detection, and technical details
- **🎨 Image Analysis**: Extract color palettes, brightness, contrast, and visual properties
- **📝 OCR Text Recognition**: Extract text from images (demo mode included, see OCR_SETUP.md for real OCR)
- **📱 Device Location**: Capture current GPS coordinates with each photo
- **🔧 EXIF Support**: Basic EXIF detection with enhancement suggestions (see EXIF_SETUP.md)
- **📁 Multiple Formats**: Support for JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP files

### Advanced Features
- **OCR Text Recognition**: Extract text from captured images (see OCR_SETUP.md to enable)
- **Export Functionality**: Download extracted data as JSON or text files
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy copying of extracted text and data
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for processing
- **Demo Mode**: Works out of the box with simulated OCR for testing
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd react-location-cam-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Enable Advanced Features (Optional)
- **Real OCR**: See `OCR_SETUP.md` for text extraction setup
- **Full GPS Extraction**: See `EXIF_SETUP.md` for complete GPS location extraction

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

### Basic Operations
1. **Location**: Click "Get My Location" to request location access
2. **Camera**: Click "Start Camera" to begin camera stream and capture photos
3. **Upload**: Drag & drop images or click to browse and upload existing images
4. **Analysis**: Each image (captured or uploaded) can be analyzed with multiple tools

### Information Extraction Tools
1. **📍 GPS Location Extractor**: Extract GPS coordinates from image EXIF data
2. **📊 Detailed Metadata**: Extract comprehensive file and image properties
3. **🎨 Image Analysis**: Analyze colors, brightness, contrast, and visual properties  
4. **📋 Information Extractor**: Get device info, current location data, and technical details
5. **📝 OCR Text Recognition**: Extract text from images with confidence scores
6. **💾 Export Options**: Download data as JSON, copy coordinates/text to clipboard

### What Information is Extracted
- **Image Metadata**: Dimensions, file size, format, aspect ratio
- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates, accuracy, timestamp, map links
- **Color Analysis**: Dominant colors, brightness, contrast levels
- **Text Recognition**: OCR with confidence scores and statistics
- **Device Information**: Browser, device type, capture timestamp
- **Technical Details**: Processing time, word count, line count

## Browser Requirements

- Modern browser with support for:
  - Geolocation API
  - MediaDevices API (getUserMedia)
  - Canvas API
- HTTPS connection (required for camera access on most browsers)

## React Features Used

- **useState**: Managing component state
- **useRef**: Direct DOM access for video and canvas elements
- **useCallback**: Optimizing function references
- **Functional Components**: Modern React patterns
- **Event Handling**: User interactions and media events

## Permissions

The app will request:
- Location access for GPS coordinates
- Camera access for photo capture

## Extending the App

You can enhance this app by adding:
- Image analysis and object detection
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- EXIF data extraction
- Image filters and editing
- Cloud storage integration
- Real-time image processing
- Redux for state management
- TypeScript for type safety

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)

## Security Notes

- Always serve over HTTPS in production
- Camera and location access require user permission
- Consider privacy implications when handling location/image data
